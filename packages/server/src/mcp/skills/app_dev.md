# App Development Guide

## Workflow

To create a new app from scratch:
1. `write_ts(path: "src/main.ts", content: "...")` — creates a new sandbox, returns sandboxId
2. `deploy(sandbox: sandboxId, appId: "my-app")` — auto-compiles, installs to `apps/`, appears on desktop

To edit an existing app:
1. `clone(appId)` — copies source into a new sandbox, returns sandboxId
2. Edit with `write_ts` or `apply_diff_ts` using that sandboxId
3. `deploy` back to the same appId

Optional: use `compile(sandbox)` separately if you want a preview URL before deploying.

## Sandbox Structure

Entry point is `src/main.ts`. Split code into multiple files (e.g., `src/utils.ts`, `src/renderer.ts`) and import them from main.ts — avoid putting everything in one file.

## Bundled Libraries

Available via `@bundled/*` imports (no npm install needed):

{{BUNDLED_LIBRARIES}}

Example:
```ts
import { v4 as uuid } from '@bundled/uuid';
import anime from '@bundled/anime';
import { format } from '@bundled/date-fns';
```

## Storage API

Available at runtime via `window.yaar.storage` (auto-injected, no import needed):

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `save(path, data)` | Write file (`string \| Blob \| ArrayBuffer \| Uint8Array`) |
| `read(path, opts?)` | Read file (`opts.as`: `'text' \| 'blob' \| 'arraybuffer' \| 'json' \| 'auto'`) |
| `list(dirPath?)` | List directory → `[{path, isDirectory, size, modifiedAt}]` |
| `remove(path)` | Delete file |
| `url(path)` | Get URL string for `<a>`/`<img>`/etc. |

Files are stored in the server's `storage/` directory. Paths are relative (e.g., `"myapp/data.json"`).

```ts
// Save
await yaar.storage.save('scores.json', JSON.stringify(data));
// Read
const data = await yaar.storage.read('scores.json', { as: 'json' });
// Get URL for display
const imgUrl = yaar.storage.url('photos/cat.png');
```

## Deploy

`deploy(sandbox, appId, ...)` creates the app folder in `apps/`, copies compiled files, and generates `SKILL.md` so the app appears on the desktop.

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `name` | Title-cased appId | Display name shown on desktop |
| `icon` | "🎮" | Emoji icon |
| `keepSource` | `true` | Include `src/` so the app can be cloned later |
| `skill` | auto-generated | Custom SKILL.md body. The `## Launch` section with the correct iframe URL is always auto-appended — only write app-specific instructions, usage guides, etc. |
| `appProtocol` | auto-detected | Set explicitly if auto-detection (scanning HTML for `.app.register`) isn't reliable |
| `fileAssociations` | none | File types this app can open. Array of `{ extensions: string[], command: string, paramKey: string }`. Each entry maps file extensions to an `app_command` call — `command` is the command name and `paramKey` is the parameter key for the file content. |

## Runtime Constraints

Compiled apps run in a **browser iframe sandbox**. They are subject to these hard constraints:

- **No Node.js APIs** — No `fs`, `process`, `child_process`, `net`, etc. This is a browser environment.
- **No server processes** — Apps cannot listen on ports, spawn servers, or run background daemons.
- **No OAuth flows** — OAuth code-for-token exchange requires a server-side `client_secret`. Iframe apps cannot safely perform this. Use the API-based app pattern instead (see below).
- **Browser `fetch()` only** — Apps can make HTTP requests, but they are subject to CORS restrictions. Many APIs will block direct browser requests.
- **No localStorage/IndexedDB** — Use `window.yaar.storage` for persistence (server-side, survives across sessions).
- **Self-contained** — Apps must not depend on external servers, localhost services, or infrastructure outside the iframe.

## Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes to avoid when building apps:

- **Don't guess API endpoints** — Only use endpoints from `skill("host_api")`. If an endpoint isn't listed there, it doesn't exist. Never try multiple speculative URL patterns hoping one works.
- **Don't build OAuth clients as compiled apps** — OAuth requires server-side token exchange with a `client_secret`. Instead, build an API-based app (SKILL.md only) where the user provides a personal access token, stored via `apps_write_config`.
- **Don't assume external servers are running** — There is no backend at `localhost:3000` or any other port. Apps must be fully self-contained.
- **Don't replicate server functionality in iframe** — If the app needs to call external APIs that require auth, the AI agent should handle HTTP calls via `http_get`/`http_post` MCP tools and relay data via App Protocol.
- **Don't hardcode localhost URLs** — Apps run on whatever host YAAR is served from.

### Right Pattern for External Service Integration

```
Option A: API-based app (preferred for API wrappers)
  apps/github/SKILL.md → describes GitHub API, auth flow
  User provides PAT → stored via apps_write_config
  AI calls GitHub API via http_get/http_post → renders in windows

Option B: Compiled app + AI-mediated API (for rich UI)
  Compiled iframe app handles UI/display only
  AI agent handles external API calls via MCP tools
  App Protocol bridges the two:
    app_query → display data from AI to app
    app_command → user actions from app to AI
```
